		<ul>
			<li>Professional Background: Born and raised in NC, worked in fast food, then as a pediatric medical assistant. Now as a contractor for an AI group. I studied at FTCC and now UNCC </li>
			<li>Academic Background: I mean...highschool and now my second college campus at UNCC </li>
			<li>Background in subject matter of the course: uh...none. Hence why I'm in the first class for it </li>
			<li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10, because Apple wants to make it as hard for people as possible to get anything done </li>
			<li>Courses I'm in and why:
				<ul>
					<li>ITCS 3160 - DataBase Design and Implementation - I am required to take it to continue in my degree</li>
					<li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development - I am also required to take this </li>
					<li>MATH 1242 - Calculus II - because the school hates people who are in STEM that aren't engineers or mathematicians </li>
					<li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Privacy and Security - I am concentrating in Cybersecurity, so that's kind of important </li>
					<li>ITSC 3146 - Intro to Operating Systems and Networking - OS is an important part of keeping things secure, given that methods may change for each </li>
				</ul>  
			</li>
			<li> Funny story: 
				 one time I got blindsided on asphalt because a guy thought I took his pringles (I didn't) </li>
				
			<li> I would like to share: 
				 I'm having to learn 3 new programming languages this semester. 
			</li>

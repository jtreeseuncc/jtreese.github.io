				Welcome to Java

		<div id="paragraphText">
		<p>
			Hi there! Welcome to D.I von Briesen's Java fundamentals webpage, we're happy to have you. If you're here, it's probably because you are in one of his classes, or simply want to learn Java.
			Either way, you came to the right place. This site has most of the things you need to get a good start at programming, particularly in Java. 
			There are lots of things to do and see here, but I'll go through a quick overview of the site and why we made it.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Lessons: Here you'll find lessons and instructions on what, when, where, why, and how things work in java. They range from basic starter coding fundamentals to more advanced topics specific to Java.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Foundations: This one is the bedrock. Lectures, instructions, and more on how to start with programming and setting yourself up to succeed. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Videos: These are some videos to help you work on the dozens of terms, commands, shortcuts and definitions that you will need to know! They also correspond with the lessons of the same name.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Resources: If you can't find what you need here, you should be able to find who has it. This has links to other great websites and people that have more info than we do here, there are lots of helpful tips and tricks to keep you moving forward!
			</li>
			
			<li>
				About Us: Who we are, and what we do. You can read a quick background on Professor vB and myself here. It also has some links to projects and other connections you may want to make.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			All this is here so that you can get better (or get started) at programming. Whether you're in college, highschool, or learning on your own, these resources are here to help. 
			If you're in Professor von Briesen's classes, then this is material that he would like you to learn and thinks is highly beneficial for you. So go on and check out the rest of the site

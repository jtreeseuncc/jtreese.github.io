	<p>
	Thanks for looking more into us here at Jaudiced Tapir. We are a computer science and web development company. Here you can check out what we do and why you should choose us over WIX or...anyone else.

	<ul>
		<li>We have hands! Since we have had hands we could use them. Meaning that it is possible for us to code on a keyboard</li>
		<li>Our jaundice keeps us from moving too much, so you know we will be at our computers until it is absolutely necessary to leave!</li>
		<li>Much like the tapir we are very good at having beating hearts (for the most part) so we are alive and can make your website!</li>
		<li>We have one dude who is incredibly fluent in the necessary programming languages and so he works really fast!</li>
		<li>We only have one guy who knows how to code and design, the rest are just friends that don't really do anything, but they are nice!</li>
	</ul>
